This program uses ifstream and ofstream to search through a txt line by line and ask the user if they know the person.
The user is given four options: y = yes, n = no, q = move back to the previous name, and s, which saves everything to a new file, "saveQuiz.txt" which is created when the program is run. 
saveQuiz will be put in the same folder as the executable program.
allStudentNames.txt can be changed with any set of student names so long as the delimiter is an endline character "\n".
When the end of the file is reached, the test will conclude and the user will be informed of what percentage of the school he knows, how many people that is, and how many people
he still needs to meet.
